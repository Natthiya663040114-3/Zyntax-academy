      <h1>Web Concepts Q&A</h1>
  
      <h2>1. Purpose of the index.html file</h2>
      <p>The <code>index.html</code> file acts as the main document that the browser loads first when visiting a website. It's usually responsible for rendering the initial layout and acts as the default page if no specific file is requested.</p>
  
      <h2>2. What URL was used and what protocol?</h2>
      <p>To preview the site during development, I accessed it via a URL like <code>http://localhost:5173</code>. Since it doesn't begin with <code>https://</code>, the protocol in use is <strong>HTTP</strong>, meaning it's not encrypted.</p>
  
      <h2>3. Status code for index.html and its meaning</h2>
      <p>The web server responded with a status code <strong>200</strong>. This signifies that the file was found and successfully returned to the client without any errors.</p>
  
      <h2>4. How to identify local hosting vs a public site?</h2>
      <p>When the site is accessed through <code>localhost</code> or an internal IP address, it's a local environment. If accessed via a custom domain or public URL, then it's hosted online for global access.</p>
  
      <h2>5. Tools used for checking server response</h2>
      <p>I used the built-in Developer Tools in the browser, particularly the "Network" tab, which allows real-time tracking of request and response data, including headers and status codes.</p>
